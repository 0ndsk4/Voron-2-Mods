## Better Front Idlers
##### Credits:
- Myself? :-)

###### Printing:
- Default voron settings, correct orientation, no supports needed!

###### Bom: (Multiply with 2 for Left+Right)
- 2x M3x30 SHCS
- 1x M3x8 or M3x10
- 2x M3 Washer
- 2x M5 Washer
- 2x 695zz Bearing
- 1x 5x18 Pin (g6)
- 2x 3x6 Magnets

###### Description:
- The default idlers have the issue, at least for me, that the tensioning screw, splits the 2 pieces apart. Well and if i make anyway a mod, i can try to improve it in every direction.
- This Front Idlers should be much stiffer either.
- The idlers are 9mm thinner (For people with bigger AB's), this wasn't my intention, but somehow it happened.

For more Pictures, visit the Pics folder.
- Please remember, i am updating the CAD, but i won't update always the pictures.
- The pictures are already a bit behind at the time of uploading. (But nothing special, only minor optical optimizations)
