## Stiffer DIN Mount
##### Credits:
- Voron-Team: Its the default generic DIN Mount, but modified!

###### Printing:
- Default voron settings, correct orientation, no supports needed!

###### Bom:
- 2x M2x10 Self-tapping Screw

###### Description:
- Stiffer generic Din Bracket (same as the one for the pi, but it sits much tighter on the din rail. I found the voron ones a bit wobbly on the din rails) You can use this bracket for everything else.
