# WIP 
- This Repo is only for testing purposes, no one tryed Misumi RBPB5 so far, so please see this as Warning!
- This mod gets first reviewed by me once the RBPB5 bearing arrives. I don't even know at this time of writing, if its even better as ELGM05 or GE5C. So please stay tuned or use hartk's version!
- I have even missmatched some Pictures, there are older and newer versions. Actual versions are always as CAD available.
- STL's will be available, after i tested those bearings!

## Misumi RBPB5 (Gucci GE5C)
##### Credits:
- @hartk1213 [Original GE5C Mod](https://github.com/hartk1213/MISC/tree/main/Voron%20Mods/Voron%202/2.4/Voron2.4_GE5C "Original GE5C Mod") (He has too much nice things, please visit his Github Page)
- His Design is made for GE5C and Igus ELGM-05
- He inspired me for this here and many more things :-)

###### Printing:
- Default voron settings, correct orientation, no supports needed!

###### Bom: (Multiply with 4 for all corners)
- 1x Misumi RBPB5
- 1x DIN125-M5 (Shim)
- 1x M5x22 (BHCS/ISO 7380)
- 4x M3x16 SHCS
- 1x M3x12 SHCS (Screw Version Only)
- 4x 6x3 Magnets (Magnetic Version Only)

- The M5x22 doesn't exists. So buy an M5x25 and grind it down to 22. As alternative i think i will make soon simply flatter belt clamps. That way you can simply buy an M5x20 and the M3x10 needs to be replaced with an M3x8. Win/Win

###### Description:
- The whole reason for this is, that GE5C bearings have some play in them. Igus ELGM05 should be better (but i cant confirm, they will arrive soon for comparing either), and hopefully the Misumi RBPB5 bearings have almost no play.
- Misumi mentions in the specsheets max 0,035mm axial play. Igus and GE5C have no axial play specifications.
- This means for me, that with some Grease (Mobilux EP1/EP2), should remove almost all play and the uneven Gantry (it will always press the bearings outside/inside), will do the rest.
- But this all needs testings and confimations. Till then, stay simply tuned and ignore this whole repo.
