- Eddie from the Voron-Team (From his awesome Misumi Led Clips)

###### Printing:
- Default voron settings, correct orientation, no supports

###### Bom:
- Nothing

###### Description:
- It's a stupid Clip to hide your cables stiff and secure inside that extrsion cutout.
- You can scale this in Z-Size to whatever you want. By default it's 8mm, as i find it the perfect size.
- Please don't even try to print only one of this, it's tinyyy, you need layertime xD
