## Wago 221 DIN Mount
##### Credits:
- Voron Team :-)

###### Printing:
- Tolerances are very tight, print only with calibrated flowrate
- Default voron settings, correct orientation, no supports

###### Bom:
- 2x M2x10 Self-tapping Screw

###### Description:
- Simple design for 1/2/3 x 221 5-port wagos. I didn't found anything here that is mountable to din rails, so i made one simply.
- The wagos are sitting in there pretty extreme, so you don't need to worry about opening & closing them on the mount itself.
